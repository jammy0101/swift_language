# Swift Language Playground 🚀

This repository contains my **daily Swift language practice** using **Swift Playgrounds**.  
The goal of this repo is to **learn Swift fundamentals deeply** and build a strong foundation for **iOS development**.

> I am a Flutter developer, and this repository helps me understand Swift by practicing concepts step-by-step.

## 📌 What This Repository Is For

- Learning **Swift language basics**
- Practicing **core programming concepts**
- Understanding Swift syntax before moving to **UIKit / SwiftUI**
- Comparing Swift concepts with Dart (Flutter)

This is **not an app**, it is a **learning playground**.
